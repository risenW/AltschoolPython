# Putting all the lessons we have learnt from classes and objects together,
# we will create a project that will help us understand the concepts better.

# Project description:
# We will create a simple banking system that will allow us to create bank accounts,
# deposit money into the accounts, withdraw money from the accounts, and check the balance of the accounts.
# We will create a class called Account that will serve as a template for other classes to inherit from.

# The Account class will have the following properties:
# 1. account_number - This will be a unique number that will be assigned to each account.
# 2. account_type - This will be the type of account. It can be either savings or current.
# 3. balance - This will be the amount of money in the account.
# 4. account_holder - This will be the name of the person that owns the account.

# The Account class will have the following methods:
# 1. deposit(amount) - This method will be used to deposit money into the account.
# 2. withdraw(amount) - This method will be used to withdraw money from the account.
# 3. get_balance() - This method will be used to check the balance of the account.
# 4. get_account_number() - This method will be used to get the account number of the account.
# 5. get_account_type() - This method will be used to get the account type of the account.
# 6. get_account_details() - This method will be used to get the account details of the account.

# We will create two classes called SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount that will inherit from the Account class.
# The SavingsAccount class will have the following methods:
# 1. get_account_type() - This method will override the get_account_type() method in the Account class.
# 2. get_account_details() - This method will override the get_account_details() method in the Account class.

# The CurrentAccount class will have the following methods:
# 1. get_account_type() - This method will override the get_account_type() method in the Account class.
# 2. get_account_details() - This method will override the get_account_details() method in the Account class.
